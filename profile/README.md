51Degrees has a diverse team of engineers with deep skills in each language and platform allowing us to improve code bases and introduce modern best practices – which improves the solution ergonomics for customers – and means less work to integrate, eagerness to try and easily work with our product.<br><br>
**Fully automated tests** are run nightly across all supported languages (C/C++, .NET, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Node.js, and Go) and platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux) - covering all recent versions of OS's and language runtimes – 1000s of tests are run every night.<br><br>
Check out our [dashboard](https://github.com/51degrees/common-ci/blob/main/DASHBOARD.md) that allows us to make sure tests succeed on either the new code or existing code – and quickly discover and react to any issues.
