51Degrees has a diverse team of engineers with deep skills in each language and platform allowing us to improve code bases and introduce modern best practices.

We have [fully automated tests](https://github.com/51degrees/common-ci/blob/main/DASHBOARD.md) that run nightly across C/C++, .NET, Java, NGINX, Python, PHP, Node.js, and Go. We also [test platforms]( https://51degrees.com/documentation/4.5_product_summaries__tested_versions.html) (Windows, Mac, Linux), covering all recent versions of the operating system and language runtimes.

See our [performance benchmarks]( https://51degrees.com/documentation/4.5/_product_summaries__benchmarks.html) for each language.
